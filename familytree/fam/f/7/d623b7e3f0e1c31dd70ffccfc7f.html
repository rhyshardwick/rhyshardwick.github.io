												In 1919 Guilthwaite Hall was offered for sale by the ownders to John William for the price of £14,000, John William refused to buy saying "the Hardwicks had always been tenants and they woudl always stay tenants".  The ownders then put Guilthwaite Hall for sales on the open market, it was bought by Redman Chambers who wanted to live there himself, the seeling price may seem high but the story goes that the mining rights for the land were sold a short time later for £14000.  John William and Mary had then to think about their future home.  Annie, their eldest child,  her husband Ernest George Gregory and their 11 children lived in Beech House at Guilthwaite (now known as Barn house) which was owned by John William and Mary.  John William decided that they would buy another house for Annie and her family, this house was on The Green at Whiston, Annies and her family would move into this house and he, along with his family, woudl move into NBeech House.  Unfortunately Annie did not want to move down into Whiston instead she and her family moved across the road into a rented house.  When everyone was installed intheir new homes, the faming implements, stock and live stock from Guilthwaite Hall was sold at auction and the tenancy to all bt a few acres of farming land was given up, the tenancy to these last few acre's was given up in February 1929, noone of John William's children were interested in farming, thies was the end of many generations of farmers of the Hardwick Family.
