			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				From "Hardwick Family Tree 1993"
				</p>
				<p>
				"Robert became a pupil at the boarding school of Mr Davison at Whiston, where he became friends with John Dobb Styring, this resulting in frequent visits to Brecks House, Dalton, the home of Thomas Styring where Robert met John's sister Mary Ann Styring, this relationship resulted in marriage when they were aged 20 years.   Robert Spendlove was one of the best known men of his day in Rotherham.  Possessed of ample funds, Robert Spendlove lived luxiously and spent his money freely in entertaining such company as his buoyant spirits demanded.  Wild and reckless though his habits were, he never forgot his gentlemanly upbringing.  
				</p>
				<p>
				Robert and Mary were successful business people, they ran the Ship Hotel, Westgate, Rotherham from 1849-1852, the High House, Rotherham from 1859-1860, the Queens Hotel, Masbro from 1862-1866, Robert was also a cab proprietor and cattle dealer firstly from 48 Westgate and then from premises at Masbro from 1852-1863, they also ran a butchers shop in the shambles, Rotherham, which is now known as the Imperial Buildings, Mary continued to run this business after Robert Died.  
				</p>
				<p>
				Robert was a fun loving person who would bet on anything and the Ship Hotel soon became the centre for the wild spirits of the town.  On one occasion one wager was that he could trot from the town hall at Sheffield to the Parish Church at Doncaster in less than one our, he won the bet, another wager for a large sum of money that he could sit in front of the clock at the Crown Bar and for one hour keep pace with the ticking of the seconds repeating the words "Here she goes, there she goes" to do this he sat moving his head from side to side in time with the ticking of the clock repeating those words.  His wife having been informed of what was going on rushed to the scene and after exerting all the influence both physical and mental she possessed, failed to move her husband from his purpose.  Concluding that he must have temporarily lost his mind, a policeman was sent for.  The contest was brought to an abrupt end.  During the diversion created by Mrs Spendlove's arrival, the holder of the wager made himself scarce carrying off the stakes with him.  At another time during a visit to York he bought a bear, which he expected would provide fun for his friends at the ship hotel.  Unfortunately it's loving hugs were not appreciated by the customers, the bear became so fierce that it had reluctantly to be disposed of.
				</p>
				<p>
				Mary, his 'better half' in name and deed, possessed business acumen of no mean order, successfully managed her husband's bsinesses.  Despite her watchfulness her husband repeatedly got into trouble.  Although Mary Ann enjoyed a joke and a bit of fun herself, she never allowed such frivolities to interfere with business.  "
